S&P500 price data
Both datasets are provided in the same Excel workbook.


Steps Performed:

Imported and cleaned both datasets in Excel using Power Query.
Standardized and combined the data into a single table.
Calculated key statistics: minimum, maximum, average, percentage differences, and standard deviation.
Identified the dates of minimum and maximum values.
Created a PivotTable to analyze monthly standard deviation.
Built visualizations: line chart (trend) and box & whisker chart.
Converted formulas to values using a macro for easy sharing.


Key Insights:

Bitcoin shows high volatility and risk, with potential for profit.
S&P500 is more stable and predictable.
Standard deviation for Bitcoin does not show a clear trend toward stability.
